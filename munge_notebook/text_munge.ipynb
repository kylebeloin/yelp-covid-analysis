       "[\"We were at the Trader Joe's and felt a little hungry, needed a takeout place that was different.... we pulled up, saw the sign with online ordering, placed our order and got a gyro, a schwarma gyro , some tabouleh and a vegetarian falafel gyro. Holy crap was it good. When I went inside to grab it, everything looked SO CLEAN, so fresh and healthy! We all loved it, two we got spicy, one no, I highly recommend, it's not overwhelming. Picky kid got an order of fries and even they were fresh and delicious. Now we will be going here EVERY TIME we go to Trader Joe's. This was easily the best gyro I have ever had in my life.\",\n",
       " \"Just had the most sour Cuban Espressos ever. Wish I had tried it inside instead of to go so I could've let her know to switch it. Usually this place is perfect with drinks I get so it was just a one time mistake, but the the espresso today was disgusting. 3 stars for usually being on point here though and should be 5 other than today.\",\n",
       " \"The Mahi Reuben is SPECIAL. \\xa0I'm so glad I found this place. \\xa0I can't wait to go back and try everything else.\",\n",
       " \"No customer service skills. The lady was rude to my husband and didn't give him a chance to add to our order. It was our first time ordering here but we had takeout since the Covid-19 pandemic isn't allowing anyone to eat in. The food was just okay nothing special the fish tacos tasted hard and dry so we weren't impressed by the food either. Won't be returning.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of my go-to places for dim sum. All the dim sum dishes are presented very nicely. The moment you bite inside these adorable little salty egg yolk buns, the salted egg custard inside oozes out! That's definitely what you're looking for in a molten lava bun! The bunny coconut pudding is also very cute and tasty. Currently, during COVID-19, they are still offering take-out and delivery, with 20% off take-out too if you pay with cash.\",\n",
       " 'We went on 8/26/20for the crab leg dinner. It was delicious. The service was nice and overall a great night. My only recommendation would be for crab leg night, to offer cocktail forks or something else to help get the meat from the shells.',\n",

       " \"No masks! No social distancing! Apparently they are pretending that covid-19 doesn't exist and that the spike in cases has nothing to do with the irrational irresponsible behavior restaurants like Isabella's are perpetuating.

Period.\",\n",

       " 'I love Sandbar Chandler but I\\'ve been very disappointed with Sandbar Gilbert. I\\'ve given this location so many chances as it\\'s close to home however the \"manager\" here lacks customer service skills and could work on his communication skills as well. He\\'s rude to the staff and to customers.',\n",
       " 'My son and I really needed to get out of the house. He saw this restaurant had great reviews and vegan options. It is a very nice, clean, semi-upscale establishment. I think it has a varied and interesting menu. The staff was young and cordial. They were not chatty. We were seated in a comfortable spot, and although we did have to wait awhile for our server to return from the other area she was working at, she was pleasant and provided good service. My son was very happy with his lentil bowl, it was a good size. His cauliflower plate was also well received. It was an appetizer. I ordered the tuna salad as a wrap. It came with sweet potato chips that were tasty.The wrap, however, was very odd. Basically what they did was to roll up the lettuce into the tortilla. I decided that I would just make it back into a salad, because there was no way of picking it up.When I saw the filling for the wrap, it was predominantly lettuce. There was a sprinkle of tuna buried within, and a few sprinkles of seeds, etc. I would not order this again. It was horribly overpriced!',\n",
       " \"Since moving here from New Jersey my family have been customers. \\xa0Sad to say lately we have not received good service - no garlic when you order, pie sloppy cuts, lots if spots no cheese. \\xa0I don't even bother to call I figure we are all going through something. \\xa0Well yesterday really got bad , ordered 2 pies to be delivered to pool for kids. \\xa0Asked that the pies be cut in children slices - not only did they not cut pie they didn't even deliver paper products. \\xa0We had to send some back home for knife and paper products. \\xa0I think the staff has changed and they are now focused on making money NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Slow down and provide better caring service and you will have long standing customers.\",\n",
       " 'This place is rad, very unique and cool artsy menu. Delicious cocktails with fun names and fancy! Unique and tasty snacks too!',\n",
       " \"This review is for the lunch buffet that we had today which was out of bounds delicious. Delicious is such an ordinary word so let's call it amazing. \",\n",
       " \"Love these guys. \\xa0Emigdio is always so friendly, and the food is fantastic.My go-to is the tinga de pollo burrito. \\xa0My wife (vegetarian) likes the bean and cheese soft tacos.I've tried the gorditas, and they're good as well. \\xa0But I love the burritos.We usually get a bag of chips and a side of beans. \\xa0The beans are soooo good with chips.There's so little good Mexican in YYC. \\xa0This is top of the list for my wife and me!\",\n",
       " \"Wow. The atmosphere is nice. We sat outside. The bathrooms were nice. We started with the gnocchi and added the bacon. It was light and fluffy. I would get this again. The portion was large enough for 3 maybe 4 adults to split as an appetizer. I had the chili which was flavorful and delicious. My wife had the dumpling soup which I wanted to have more of a kick of flavor. Maybe it was because I had the chili it seemed less seasoned. Then I had the short rib which was so tender. My wife had the filet. She ordered it medium and it came out a little more done than that. She was ok with it though. The seasoning was on point. I would have ordered my medium rare and probably sent it back if it was overcooked. I had the habanero drink which was interesting because it finished with a spice but I wouldn't order it again. I also had a watermelon margarita which lacked the watermelon flavor as advertised. My wife had the blood orange cosmo which was good but sugary.For desert we had the blueberry copper.

Thankfully Rikki is on top of her game and always on her toes and came to the rescue . Not only did Leah ignore me for more water, but when she brought my food to me she did a \"drive by\" drop off. \\xa0Didn\\'t ask if everything else was fine or if we needed anything . After finishing my meal i attempted to stop her to grab my plate and once again ignored but she stopped at every other table but ours. As a manager I expect better service from them than your own waitress and bartenders doesn\\'t matter regulars or not . This is definitely something that needs to be brought to higher up attention and taken care of .

It was 99 % egg with some chorizo crumbles here and there with a smidge of avocado. It came with a side of salsa which was just pace picante. I doused the first half of my burrito with cholula and even that could not save this nasty burrito. The cinnamon roll had clearly been microwaved and the ingredients for the frosting were separating.

Tangy and flavorful! My fiancé had the egg drop and said it was good but he would have liked a little more flavor, he added some pepper and it was good. Then we had an egg roll...... do yourself a favor, order the egg roll!!! Oh my gosh! Delicious! It was crunchy and tasty! Then for our main meals we had the orange chicken and Szechuan chicken! The Szechuan was my favorite! We will definitely order both again! Also there was so much food, we had left overs of everything! Next time I will take a picture before we eat it all!',\n",

At 15 minutes, I notice they are starting to make my torta. \\xa0At least I know it's freshly made but I was still waiting the place was filling up. \\xa0I finally got my order and after driving down the road, I stopped at a red light to check my order and there were no chips and salsa! \\xa0Ugh! \\xa0I was going to be late for my lunch appointment so I kept going and took it as a lesson learned to check before leaving. \\xa0Luckily, the food helped with this review. \\xa0 The torta was hot, tasty and filling. \\xa0The meat was juicy and lots of flavor. \\xa0The chicken burrito was flavorful and not dry as some chicken burritos can get.

Simply put the pizza here is amazing. Kind of on the thin side, cheesy, and just flat out amazing. Their pizza reminds me of a pizza place I had in Boston called santapiro (or something like that), so for me Boston and Pittsburgh have similar styles of pizza.

The result is superior flavor overall, where you can really taste the toppings and sauce. The pizza will still fill you up and leave you feeling heavy and happy though.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and wanting to take a break from cooking, I finally gave Angelo's a long overdue visit this week.My wife and I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and an Angelo's Special half hoagie for takeout. Both were still hot and absolutely delicious after our short walk home. Their pizza is my favorite kind from a local shop: traditional crust, a generous amount of flavorful cheese, and pepperoni that curls up for a wonderfully crisp bite. A one-topping large is around $16, and is well worth it. It's tasty, and large enough that we had enough leftovers for dinner the next day (it reheated quite well, too).I've heard great things about their hoagies, so we decided to split an Angelo's Special steak hoagie to try them out. Again, I'm sad that I waited this long to eat their amazing hoagies. The mayo sauce on the hoagie was perfect, and their was a solid filling-to-bread ratio. The bun is key- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I can't imagine a pizza shop making a better hoagie than this.Their staff was friendly and professional, and their shop was very clean in the midst of the COVID-19 shutdown madness. If you're in the Bloomfield area and are in the mood for outstanding pizza or hoagies, what are you waiting for?

For just under $26 I got a 4-piece dark meal w sides of macaroni and candied yams along with a 24oz Diet Pepsi and 2 peach cobblers. The peach cobbler was small in portion and stuffed into a small styrofoam container so it all squished together and became one glutinous monoflavored mush from what could have been a decent peach plus cobbler topping dessert. The corn muffin my meal came with was oddly crumbly yet not dry yet had a strange not quite corn taste without sweetness to it. Not good.The candied yams were blazing hot and had a stark cinnamon Christmas allspice type flavor. The macaroni was also blazing hot but delicious! It had a nice broiled cheese crust atop with good buttery cheesy flavor.The chicken was decent. Not as good as Krispy Krunchy from the gas station down the road (seriously) but not bad either. Not dry, some of the breading was a bit hard even though I got my food about half hour after they opened at 11am. For the cost I won't return. Very clean comfortable place inside and there was even someone outside sweeping the parking lot. You can tell this place isn't a dive and is well cared for and that is significant in this area.Dining room is open. Bathrooms are locked.\",\n",

The Mac & ch. was close to being very good, would have like them to be a little more cooked, that is my preference. The collard greens were not good which was highly disappointing. I love them as a side. Finally the cobbler again very disappointing, it was not bad and maybe doing it to-go didn't help. So as I implied I could be back to give them another shot, would try the fried chicken and other sides. But the reason for the 2 Stars was primarily driven by the fact not one employee had a mask on!! This is totally against present regulations and just plane stupid/disrespectful to customers. COVID is still around!!! Also 90% of the customers didn't have masks hanging inside waiting for their food. Not seating and eating but waiting for their pickup.

The first two items came out within a few minutes, but the lechon took probably 20-25 minutes total.Don't be scared of the dinuguan!

       " '5 photosThe food and prices are so good here ! I was only visiting a few days but niece just moved here so I HAD to bring her and her boyfriend to try this place and they loved it also! What sealed the deal was the service !! A super cool woman named Zo helped us the first time & she was great with recommendations since they have a pretty large menu I had trouble deciding. Her recommendations did not disappoint! They are also connected to a bar so we were able to have a few drinks too! Zo only works two days a week though so if you want her gotta go on a Monday or Tuesday :)Our other waitress was also awesome when we came the second time! The cook in the back was even very chill and good attitude , like the people who work here truly seem like they enjoy their job and have good spirits. So happy to have found this place so whenever we visit our niece in Vegas we will be sure to stop in! Good food, good prices, and good people!',\n",
       " \"Walked in for lunch after seeing how much wings they sold for the year and how many flavors they advertised. \\xa0Was really in the mood for wings.The menu is on the counter and you check off what you want, the flavors were basic, I asked how big the wings where, the cook says they're jumbo, pretty big, so I opted for just the 6 wings. \\xa0I asked how many flavors can I pick, he said up to 2 so I got the spicy garlic and the house special. \\xa0Also a side of chips for 1.25, for drinks I just got water which was tap water they served.Waited full 30 minutes for 6 wings and chips. \\xa0Not like the place was busy, it was pretty slow around 1 pm.When the wings came out, the server placed it on the table, and they were the smallest wings you've ever seen, 3 on each side with the chips in the middle. \\xa0I asked if these were the jumbo wings, and she mentioned they come in even smaller. \\xa0I should of just left right away, but I was a dumb enough to stay and eat since I was so hungry. \\xa0Wings had no flavor, in fact it was pretty dry and burnt on the edges, not as advertised. \\xa0A middle school lunch has better flavor than this place. \\xa0No wonder there was few customers. \\xa0Bill came out to 8.93, I paid with a 20.00 note she gave me back a 5, and the rest 1's.... I guess she was expecting a good tip. \\xa0I left a buck on the table, and that's being nice. \\xa0While I was about to leave another gentlemen walks in not knowing what to order, I should have pulled him to the side and told him definitely not the wings. \\xa0Overall very disappointed, will never ever come back. \\xa0the worst wing experience ever. \\xa0I should have gotten paid to eat that garbage. \\xa0The next time I see a plate like that, I'm out the door.\",\n",

We went late and they were out of soup, so we got a salad.

The guy owner (I feel ashamed for not remembering his name..) is always there in the morning. Register counter is by the door, so he always greets customers as they walk in. He is so enthusiastic about his pastries and quiché. There is a menu on the wall, but whenever I come, I always ask him what he has for the day. The way he describes them always makes me want to order all of them. They have outdoor and indoor sitting. For indoor sitting, you get to choose to sit on a sofa, at a regular height table or higher top table. I sit at different spots whenever I come depending on my mood. I usually go for a vanilla latte and a plain croissant. Vanilla latte is made at perfect level of sweetness. I don't taste too much of the vanilla syrup, or the bitterness. It's just right enough that at every sip, I can taste the espresso, a vain hint of vanilla, and milk fat. Their croissants are so authentic. Buttery, airy, and flaky.

I have to be honest, sometimes I swing by just to get a Thai Tea. Milk Tea is delicious as well. The large drinks are 24 oz, compared to other places - the price for your drink is great!

As I waited to get my coffee, plates of instagram worthy dishes kept coming out of the kitchen and I knew I had to come back. Fast forward to today\\'s brunch with my boyfriend. After some trouble deciding what dish to try first, he finally settled on the halloumi and I customized a toast similar to their avocado toast minus the cheese and tomatoes.

This little Beaver Tail stand is right by the water in a great location. They have a variety of Beaver tail flavors. I chose my favorite flavor combination (peanut butter and chocolate-Reeses). I have to say it wasn't really what I was picturing. The texture of the dough was a little thin and it was very sweet which made it impossible for me to eat a full one, especially when I was drinking coffee and not water. However, it was still pretty good. I liked the texture a lot, just wish it wasn't quite as sweet. I loved the chewy dough though. The prices are pretty standard for what you are ordering. It was super cute inside, although a little small. I would get this again if I was in Toronto, but share with someone else because after so many bites, the sweetness got to be a little much.\",\n",

       " \"I just come here for bbq pork sticks and steamed rice. My bf doesn't like to go in because of the smell (he hates fish) but I don't mind it. It's one of those restaurants where as soon as you leave, your clothes will smell like food (typical for asian cuisine). They have a hot table facing the front and probably a ton of pots in the back boiling stews, which could be why the scent greets you as you enter. If you're filipino sometimes they will greet you with respect (Ate, Kuya) which was very surprising to me. It's the first time I've ever been greeted like that from someone who wasn't family, but it felt extremely comforting and nice, knowing that they treat their customers like family. It may be a bonus reason why I come back. Little things matter, even if it's just a smile. Support your local business and try something different. Their bbq pork skewers are a must try - saucy, smokey, and sweet! Must eat it with rice!\",\n",

What a great variety! French fries, hush puppies, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks?! Say no more. Their fried okra is amazing as well. The food always arrives hot, fresh, and never soggy. Grubhub says that Beta Bites uses their own employees for delivery.

I was charged for cheese though. When my order was finally ready (an hour later) it wasn't even all there. So I went back inside to let the woman behind the counter know what was missing including NO salsa she didn't even seem to care. I waited another 10 minutes for my missing order. She gave me cold cheese to add to my tacos-yum delicious! Nothing like placing cold cheese on your tacos to warm in the microwave because now your food is cold from having to wait for the missing food. If you cared about your customers then she should've offered something or at least showed that she cared apologies can go a long way. The only thing that was worth eating were the cinna banditos.

Seriously one of the best mango green teas I've had. I also am not a huge fan of boba, but I will definitely get the honey boba here because it's perfectly sweet and chewy! Another plus to this place is that there are alternative milks, which is a lactose intolerant girls dream! I usually stray away from dairy boba drinks due to the obvious dairy lol, but now I'm able to add oat or almond to it which is the best. My cousin tried their brown sugar boba drink with oat ilk... the tiger sugar one? I'm honestly not sure what the official name for it is, but she said it was amazing and better than The Alley.

It\\'s also horrible their yelp hours don\\'t match with their business times when you call their store. Please update your voicemail it\\'s confusing lol. Thank you. BAD SERVICE.',\n",

The milkshake I have to say was one of the most over iced, watered down, milkshakes I have ever had. It was a complete disappointment. The butter bar and the cookie were delicious. I'm not sure if the person that day blending it just added way too much ice? At the end of the milkshake there were big chunks of ice. I would come back to try a different milkshake to give this place another shot but if the results are the same I will not be returning.\",\n",

Stood there waiting for someone to look my way so I can wave. 6:52 when they finally saw me. They said they stop taking orders at 6:30. I said I put my order at 6:24. They check the computer and my order was there. **The guy comes back out to tell me that it takes 10 minutes before they get the order so it was too late.** I told them than my card got charged. He said we will decline it. \\xa0I wish that they could've texted me that my order was too late or have your info say closes at 6:30. Or have an automated reply saying that your order was declined.

       " \"3 photos 1 check-inLas Vegas weather hit triple digits today: 100 degrees!! Mood: Halo Halo (aka Filipino Shave Ice)Cafe 86 came highly recommended by Nadine C., my fellow Yelp friend from Honolulu! So, when she tagged me on a few Ube photos from their Instagram page, the cravings began and I had to visit the cafe sooner than later.As of 6/2/20, the cafe is operating Contactless! So, Pre-orders only, which means customers need to place their orders via the website or by phone. Walk-ins are still required to phone in their order.We ordered the Signature Halo Halo and Upside Down Halo Halo from the milkshake menu. I wondered why it was listed that way until I saw it in person. Yep, it is made like a milkshake! Unlike the traditional icy dessert (shave ice consistency), the base is blended and creamier. There's also boba and frosted flakes, in addition to the typical jellies and jackfruit, which was a nice surprise, but a bit unusual for me TBH. Nevertheless, I finished it all! And it's a pretty tall serving, so at $6.99, I thought it was a pretty good value.I'd love to come back once the cafe is fully open, so I can peruse the display case and order something new!Stay cool and hydrated!\",\n",

       " \"1 check-inI've had a positive experience previously and was expecting the same when I visited this restaurant last. I stopped by for a takeout order, which I made with no problem. The problems began immediately after the payment was complete. There were no chairs for people waiting for takeout orders and it was a very tight space in the front with multiple people paying or waiting to order. The dining in people were being seated by the employees so I wasn't sure if I was allowed to go into the dining area to sit and wait. So there I stood.. in the front.. for 20 minutes.. without any updates on the food nor any acknowledgement of me standing there.Then I asked how much longer it would be, and they said 5 minutes. 7 minutes passed and I ask again, and they just began packing up my food in the bag. After I received my food (which was not a huge order) after almost 30 minutes, I headed home and took out my food. First problem, they got an order wrong. I received a ramen when I ordered udon. Secondly, the meat in the gyudon I ordered was not even 1/3 of the amount I've seen on Yelp reviews. Lastly, the all food was generally lukewarm when I only traveled about 5 minutes from picking up the order. At this point, I didn't want to deal with going back and fixing my order as I was already too tired.I am terribly disappointed in this place and wouldn't recommend it as of right now. The staff seems very disoriented and chaotic, as I was hearing them struggle for the 30 minutes I've been waiting in the front. I'm not sure if I've just caught them on a bad day, or it's because of COVID, but I won't be returning at least until this whole pandemic blows over.\",\n",

When you open the doors to go inside they block it off so there's not a lot of space. There was a few people inside that were just waiting there for their order. I stood outside the door, for a couple minutes and they came out after 5 minutes. There was one person inside so I decided to come in. Apparently, they couldn't find his order that he place. When I told them my name the cashier made a comment saying he'll try and find my order. After a brief moment he said it would be another 10 minutes so they could cook the tonkatsu and asked for me to go to my car. After 10 minutes I come back in and a lady came and told me she went to the original cashier and they said it was going to be another 5-10 minutes. Ok.....I come back after 12 minutes and there's 3 different parties of people in the restaurant, with masks, but not 6 feet apart. There's no indicator on the floor for spacing. A lady behind me asked if I ordered already and I said yes and she went in front of me to ask for her order even though I waited. She received hers. I still stood in the restaurant and a gentleman came through the doors and the cashiers helped him instead of me. They finally got to me and by that time it had been 40 minutes since I arrived. They apologized for the wait and told me it had been done. I double checked if they gave extra ginger/soy sauce and the cashier said yes. I went to my car and when I checked there was no extras. I tried calling them to see if they can bring some out or anything and they answered the phone, said hello once and then hung up. I went back inside and waited a few minutes because there were several people in the restaurant again and told them I did not get my extras that I requested. He apologized and gave me a small bag. By the time I left it had been a total of 46 minutes. When I got home I checked and for my sushi platter they gave me only three packets of soy sauce and a ton of ginger. Not only was my tonkatsu not hot/warm, but the sushi didn't seem fresh. It's been 2 hours since eating and I feel like I have food poisoning. This is a disappointment. If I could ask for my time and money back, then I would.\",\n",

Many will have leftovers, but if you don't have any self control like me, you will devour it all.Start at the left of the counter. Pick your rice, then your meat, then your side. My go to order is the amarillo rice, then usually pork hock or another pork if that's not available, and the fried sweet plantains!Some of the meats are an additional charge, but you'll see it written on the glass. The upcharge items are usually $8.99 but no more than $11.99 (and that's rare to see). There's also some desserts at the end.Service is friendly, tho you may or may not get an English speaker. If you don't speak at least a little Spanish, chances are they speak more English than you do Spanish, so you'll be fine! Dining room is currently open tho they are practicing social distancing.

This is also a very convienent location with ample free parking. During normal times, you can eat inside or order to go. They have some decent lunch and dinner deals. I was particularly impressed with their current COVID19 precautions as they have the entire order area plexi-glassed off and even made a contraption with a plexi-glass doggy door type thing to give the food to people while keeping both sides protected. Also, all employees were wearing masks and customers are required to wear masks. The one downside here is that most of the employees don't have the best English skills which has led to some difficulty ordering or minor mix-ups, but they have good customer service and will correct anything mixed up.

Unfortunately we didn't make it in time but as I walked out kind of disappointed, I noticed this lady and her dog stuck in the parking lot. I told a staff member, and a few minutes later the owner came outside to try to help her. Along side my fiancé, they both tried to rock her car to get it to move, to no avail. We ended up calling a tow truck for this poor lady and we took her home. The owner offered us a free meal for helping out and today we picked it up after work. I have to say, this is the best Teriyaki chicken I have had in quite some time! The food was freshly made and by the time I got home and opened the container it was still steaming! We frequented this place since we moved to Parma but with covid they had to close. I'm so glad to see them open again and THRIVING!! The owner is an absolute gentleman, and respectful! I am wondering if they franchise because I would love to be apart of a team like this! We love every food item we have tried and the sushi burritos are absolutely mouth watering! If you are looking for a great place to eat in Parma, this is the place! I will gladly support this local business because of how the owner handled the situation with the woman who's car was stuck.

Now I expected yellow rice buuuuut it wasn't. Fortunately the rice and beans was super flavorful. I'm happy I get an extra side of it. On the to the shrimp meal...sautéed shrimp with peppers and onions served over rice and beans. Again the rice and beans are crazy good. The sautéed peppers and onions were also seasoned very well. As for the shrimp...I think they were precooked shrimps or boiled then sautéed? Regardless the flavor wasn't so much in the shrimp as it should have been by tasting the veggies. Overall the meal was very good. Things to make it better? Shrimp flavor and maybe some host sauce or something would have made up for the shrimp a bit.

I decided to order their grilled chicken on top of fractured rice along with their spring rolls. The chicken was grilled to perfection, flavors were still present but not over powering, and it was so juicy. I believe it came with a sweet fish sauce as well, adding that really took it over the top. It literally left me wanting more with a full stomach. As for the spring rolls, I would give them a solid B+. Their ingredients were fresh and the peanut sauce was delectable.

March 22nd was my daughters 15th Birthday. Due to \"quarantine\" & my less than stellar health the past year & a half we didn\\'t have a lot of options & I wasn\\'t healthy enough to make her one. Add in my dietary restrictions & the number of places to locate a slice of Birthday cake for delivery & the options narrow even more. I had to settle for non plant based options for the family & nothing for myself. I ordered several different items so everyone could have their own, generally as a family we all nibble a small taste of each other\\'s, it\\'s just a think we do no matter what we order from anywhere. We were unable even if we wanted with these however as the portions are very, very small. Maybe a bite or 2. To start, there wasn\\'t a single thing delivered that wasn\\'t several days old. Not simply \"day old\" which wouldn\\'t have been ideal but would have been better than what we got (as a former professional cake decorator & small business owner I am very very familiar with bakery & pastry items) but several days old. The icing on my daughters specific birthday cake, her very favorite, confetti cake (fun fact; that was also my favorite as a child & gives me massive nostalgia) was so hard she had to crunch and crumble into it. You couldn\\'t simply use a fork to satisfyingly serve yourself a bite. She had to lean over the counter, hold it over the container & bite down as it just crumbled & fell apart in the container. My heart sank. Poor kid just couldn\\'t win for her birthday. She doesn\\'t like lemon so even though her brother offered his piece; it wasn\\'t any better quality or a flavor she liked. The cinnamon cake was also just old & lacking, neither kids or husband would eat any of it, so there was nothing that could really fix her experience and everything went in the trash. The prices aren\\'t the easiest on the pocket book either so we won\\'t be ordering again or visiting any time in the future. Pretty crumby way to start my daughters 15th birthday during a time like this; no pun intended.',\n",

Their menu has a lot of different options for sizes, toppings, wings, and other sides and salads. The 16\" pizza is our go to with extra cheese, sausage, and mushrooms and it is always still hot by the time we get it home. The real secret is to add the extra garlic butter to the crust. It\\'s only an extra .50 and trust me it\\'s totally a game changer. I also LOVE their boneless wings in either ranch honey mustard or the garlic Parmesan. These do not taste like your freezer aisle boneless wings. They are crispy, flavorful and I don\\'t know who the genius was who decided to make a sauce out of ranch and honey mustard combined but it is to die for. Their garlic parm is seasoned well and flavorful- not packed with oil and overbearing with the garlic. They are just coated in the sauce- definitely not swimming in it. These are some of the best boneless wings I\\'ve had. Overall this is a great choice if you\\'re looking for pizza and wings. Totally worth the drive even if you\\'re not in the area.',\n",

This is cheap even for the many other food places with prices for college students. There was so much I couldn\\'t even finish it sometimes. They also had a jug of tea and a jug of water upfront and I can\\'t even count how many times I\\'ve taken that to go. I wish they had lids though because I often always spill it. I would get my tofu fried rice spicy and sometimes put on salt pepper and Sriracha. I always got soy sauce packs. Super delicious. Also the guy who works the front register and I believe also owns the store is funny. There was a meme on a u of I Facebook group with him smoking a cigarette in the back alley captioned \"when he cooks for you.\" I would definitely second that.',\n",
       " \"2 photos 1 check-inYummy amazing salad selection. I ordered the steak salad at my sister's recommendation- it was awesome! They grill the steak to your liking as soon as you order. Then all the veggies are added and mixed with dressing. It's a large portion, definitely fills you up. I took off a star for the following reasons: 1. The menu said the onions are grilled but it's not. It's raw red onion slivers. There were a lot of it too which is a bit overpowering 2. The menu said there are portobello mushrooms but it's not. It's canned mushrooms 3. The to-go utensils only includes a tiny flimsy fork which was very difficult to use. There's not a knife included so I ended up having to bite off pieces of steak from the flimsy fork. These aren't deal breakers so I'll definitely be back. I'll just customize my salad a little more and eat at home where I can use a real fork.\",\n",

Some standard salad options, wraps, and daily specials are on the menu, but I prefer to customize a fresh salad just the way I like it.I was sad when the 7th Street location closed, but this one on East Boulevard isn't too far away and satisfies my cravings. The place is fairly small, but there are a few covered tables outside to enjoy when the weather is nice. Most tables, inside and out, turn rather quickly.The crew is always friendly and keep the place very clean. My only reasons for not rating a full five stars would be not having a slightly larger selection of toppings/dressings, and that whenever I order a steak salad, my medium rare is hit or miss. In the end, always still tasty and a great go-to salad spot.\",\n",

Since my first experience, this place means more than I can really put into words, however I will still try to (and not be to long winded).I started with trying sandwhiches here, each one I tried was great. From the #15 BLT to the #5 turkey (it has cranberry on it, NOT overdone on the cranberry like others do). Next was adding one of their delicious homemade soups. I then discovered the teriyaki chicken bowl, best I have ever had! Then 2 weeks ago I had a the ramen fusion and it was outstanding. When I ordered I was offered a chance to add a protein, bonus! I chose the spicy grilled pork. Try it and add a few potstickers on the side! I still have not eaten a better potsticker ANYWHERE. They should come with a warning about their addictive nature! My son drives 35 minutes just to get the potstickers.The family that owns it is very nice and I am always happy to see them. I almost feel like a family friend when I go to their restaurant. I really appreciate the effort the entire staff puts into the food. Thank you!I have shared this place with family and friends and everyone enjoys the food.

I've tried pizza from one end of the US to the other, and to be honest I was more than a little concerned about finding good pizza in Las Vegas. I tried a couple of local favorites and they were OK, but on one particular day the pizza gods smiled down on me. I stumbled upon Cugino's. Cugino's? Not even my co-workers who live here knew about this place. Tucked away in a strip mall on Maryland, near the UNLV campus is a pizza lovers paradise. Straight out of New York, this place stands up to some best pizza I've had on the west coast. They have 3 different styles by the slice. Thin NY style, Sicilian and my new favorite Grandma style. If you grew up in an Italian house, \\xa0you know the beauty of Grandma pizza. For those in the know, El Presidente from Bar Stool Sports gave it one of the highest ratings I've seen for a West Coast pizza slice.

The noodles were thick and chewy and there was plenty of meat and cheese. I don't think I'm a huge fan of their red sauce because it's pretty neutral, but it's likely a crowd pleaser. We really liked the crust on the pizza, otherwise it was a standard pepperoni pizza! I'd like to try more on the menu.\",\n",

       " '3 photos 1 check-inIt was Friday night, my girlfriend and I wanted some pizza and a chicken parmesan sub, and Cugino\\'s Italian Deli & Pizza was the place to order from. We placed our order around 6:15PM and by 7:15PM the food was at our doorstep and ready to be devoured. The menu here is pretty standard for the most part although the number one thing to catch my eye was the addition of \"Sicilian Rice Balls\" AKA Arancini which is basically a type of rice ball. For dinner, we decided to get a basic pizza and split it in half, my side being cheese and meatball. We also each got an Arancini, and to top it off we split a chicken parmesan sub. How was the food though? This is what I thought!Meatball Pizza- The meatball pizza did not jump out and grab me, I\\'ll be honest. The pizza itself was on the thinner side and had plenty of melted cheese on it, which tasted pretty good, and I was a big fan of the large meatballs on top. Overall, the pizza was good, it just wasn\\'t anything super special.Chicken Parmesan Sub- The chicken parmesan sub was a decent size, had what appeared to be cut up chicken cutlet pieces inside and featured a good amount of both sauce and cheese. The flavour was good and I would definitely think about ordering one of these again.Sicilian Rice Ball- The Arancini was 10x better then I would of expected. This rice ball was fried to perfection, filled with tasty rice, and came with a decent marinara sauce to dip it in. Overall, Cugino\\'s might not be the best of anything I\\'ve had, but all the food I ate was enjoyable, and I would absolutely come back again and again to try some more options. Hopefully next time I\\'ll be able to dine inside.',\n",

I was told that they will substitute whatever pasta they have. My reply was it's fine if you had told me that when I paid $6 for a cup of the soup.

At first we though we wanted a nice atmosphere with ambiance, etc but unfortunately that always came with a price (and usually average food when all is said and done). I scrolled past the deli multiple times in my search because, well, it was a deli. But then I finally was convinced by the rating and massive volume of reviews to read a few and check out the pics and vids. We drove by to take a peek and decided to give it a shot. The unassuming strip mall location still almost scared us away, but we're so glad we soldiered on! We got a variety of things fro pizza to a new hot sandwich (and the garlic knots!), and could not have been more pleased. The food was amazing, and the staff was kind and clearly more of a family (probably really was!) than just workers. I'll be the first to say I'm no Italian food connoisseur, but the marinara will change your life. I could eat it with a spoon, and the rest of our meals were equally good.

The hollandaise sauce was good. But the home fries on both the plates were without seasoning. Not even salt nor pepper. I ate one toast out of the two that were on my plate, 1 bite of the homefries and left the rest. I\\'m not sure how they have the title of the \"best\" breakfast in town but it was seasoning-less and completely bland. This diner is best suited for a someone who has not been out a small town and has no idea what food with salt tastes like. There was table salt and pepper available, but come on, how about adding it to the food? Nothing was worth it.',\n",

If you\\'re looking for a good Dominos come to this one. Sadly I have to change my review after speaking with Debra. She was extremely rude and wouldn\\'t even let me get two words out on the phone. I was politely trying to have her take my last order but before I could tell her it was on a different number she cut me off and put me on hold. She gets back on the phone and says she can\\'t find my order... so I proceed to finishing my original statement attempting to give her the different number. She puts me on hold again before I can tell her I don\\'t want one item in the order.

I politely (attempt) to tell her that I always order this and have even ordered this multiple times at this specific dominos and AGAIN she interrupts me and cuts me off. The entire phone call she was clearly irritated and wouldn\\'t even let me finish my sentences. So much time could\\'ve been saved had she just let me finish a sentence.

I myself am in customer service (I have over 200 5star ratings) and do not appreciate this type of attitude. Honestly if I was her manager I would have a talk with her and if this behavior persisted she would be fired.

We got a plethora of flavors in our assortment, ranging from the classics like Sprinkled and Chocolate Frosted, to more adventurous flavors like the Cherry and the Maple Frosted. I really appreciated the variety they had. My personal favorite is the Boston Creme, although it is hard to just pick one! So I sampled a few, and they were all decently yummy. Not the best donut i've had, but definitely up there. Very soft, warm, and fresh! Onto the donuts I sampled! The Double Chocolate has a strong flavor, but it was a little dry. It was on par with the average chocolate donut-- no better no worse. The Maple Frosted Donut was my least favorite. It was a generic frosting slightly tinged with maple flavor on top of a plain donut. The flavor did not penetrate through the entire donut. The Boston Creme was amazing, I did not have any complaints. And the other cream ones were definitely the better half of the bunch as the cream compensated for the slightly dry texture. My only big critique is that I am not sure if they were warm due to being in the sun or just being fresh. I was surprised that the delivery person did not knock or do anything to indicate the arrival of the donuts. We coincidentally encountered them on the doorstep, otherwise we would not have known they had arrived. So my only complaint is about the delivery of the donuts.\",\n",

Take the drive, spend a little bit of money supporting the small business and don\\'t even worry about the calories! You\\'re welcome',\n",

       " \"2 photosIf you're craving donuts at 2am like we were, then Donut TYME is definitely your spot! They offer a variety of classic flavors and sizes range from very large to mini. Their donuts are so airy and fluffy, it's soo delicious!! You can really tell their donuts are freshly made. This place is definitely a hole in the wall that people should check out if they're ever on the east side of town.\\xa0AMBIANCE:The people are really nice and friendly. Very nostalgic feeling to the shop :)\\xa0INTERIOR/EXTERIOR DESIGN:The shop was a little outdated, but we think that's what makes it unique! The area around the shop might seem sketchy, but it's still a great place to check out.\\xa0FOOD:\\xa0These donuts are to die for! They are light! They are fluffy! And they taste incredible! The prices are even better for sure, they're very affordable!! It's less than $8 for half a dozen of donuts... Definitely get what you pay for! Bang for your buck!!\",\n",
       " \"Like I've read in a few reviews. These donuts USED \\xa0to be good. Not anymore. Nothing here to come back for. Tastes like any other donut place in town or worse because they do happen to be a little raw.\",\n",
       " 'Love this place!! Go at least once a week, donuts are always fresh, service is very friendly, and once in a while they give us free donuts which is a perk!! Try this place out, support local businesses!',\n",

       " \"This is the place to go. I live in California but I was born and raised in the Rocks. \\xa0I love Doughboys food, but what is even better are the employees. \\xa0I want to share a quick story so you know what kind of people they are. \\xa0My Mom is very old and has been in the hospital for a long time now. \\xa0She loves Italian Hoagies. \\xa0I tried ordering food through grubhub for her, they constantly lose her delivery. \\xa0Very frustrating since I am in California and can't be there to get her food myself. \\xa0Well I called Doughboy's, and problem solved. First I talked to the girl who took my order, she is a super friendly young lady, like extra friendly and helpful. \\xa0I wish I got her name. \\xa0Now, I didn't mention that with Covid, the hospital's have very strict instructions on how deliveries go. \\xa0Now the driver is delivering it, his name is Neil, he goes so far above and beyond to make sure my Mom gets her food. \\xa0I mean, this guy called me back to tell me that I gave him the wrong address and he figured it all out on his own. \\xa0This guy is the best and I really appreciated his efforts. \\xa0Seems like Doughboy's only hires the best!!!!! \\xa0I hope the owner reads this review so he can hear how good the employees are there. Can't wait to get back to the Burgh' do get a big Pizza from Doughboy's.\",\n",
       " \"My friend told me I had to try Doughboys pizza because it was one of his favorite pizzas in the area. So today I tried it and I can see why he likes it so much. Very good pizza, and the employees were very friendly. I'll put this pizza on my top 5 list for sure.\",\n",

You can phone in your order or place it online (which is our usual method).They have always delivered in the timeframe indicated.

       " \"During the pandemic I was fortunate enough to be employed. \\xa0As such we tried to spread money to local businesses. \\xa0One of those businesses was Doughboy's. \\xa0With a name like this we expected really good dough.... and we were not disappointed. \\xa0I could eat their pizza dough every day of the week. \\xa0I'm salivating a little thinking about it.... brb, I need some water.Their red sauce and cheese mixtures are really good. \\xa0We also enjoyed the topping quality. \\xa0Aside from pizza, their hoagies are killer. \\xa0They use full Mancini buns and great ingredients. \\xa0We've had the Italian and steak. \\xa0Both were very good.I wouldn't recommend the gyro... they clearly don't make enough of these to have an actual spit. \\xa0I get it, that isn't their core focus.In the end, we love this pace and have ordered multiple times since. \\xa0Give them a try.\",\n",

       " \"Really tasty pizza. Gave Doughboy's a try for the first time on Friday. We are in the midst of the Covid19 lockdown, so trying to give some new pizza places a try from our usual haunts. Online ordering said they did not deliver to me, I live in Coraopolis, so I placed a pickup order. Arrived 35 minutes after ordering and the pizza was ready. It smelled delicious during the 15 minute drive home. I was hungry and trying not to drool. Pizza was hot and fresh and had a unique flavor that we both enjoyed. Pizza is cheesy and the crust is very thick! We'll be back for more!\",\n",

They also have a really good chicken fried rice.Ordered the saltfish and bake, and the fish was a little too dry and fishy tasting, but the bake was good.',\n",
       " \"So Durango Taco have great food. But the guy who answered today was a lier. Why? Because they forgot 1item and blamed postmates for it. And I ordered off their website. Then wouldn't give me back my money. And said I need to call postmates to get it. Which was a huge lie! Whatever helps you sleep at night. Just be careful!\",\n",

At the hour mark and still no food or email/text explaining the long delay, we called to inquire and were assured the driver was almost to our house. At 1 hour 15 minute mark we gave up and cancelled. What a joke. This restaurant needs to either figure out a better delivery system, or don't bother offering delivery.\",\n",

Iced coffee and the muffins are amazing..the muffins have this crispy top that really differentiates them from the normie muffin. I just wish they incorporated more chocolate chips in the chocolate chip muffin..it only contains a few chocolate chips sprinkled on top and the rest of it is just cake. It'd also be helpful if everything in the window was labeled..as a non-frequent donut eater it's hard to tell what everything is. Always a 10/10 breakfast experience with great service!\",\n",

My absolute favorite spots for popcorn chicken is here at Easy Life Boba, those popcorn chicken are addicting, the taste and the crunch!! The second thing I love about this place is their Avocado Smoothies with Boba! Made with real Avocados and even has avocado chunks on top. If ya haven't tried, I highly recommend that you do! :)Located on Durango and Dessert in across Dessert Breeze park. Go get your self some refreshing boba and popcorn chicken and take a walk or relax at the park!\",\n",

I got the Thai Tea Milk Tea. I'm used to mine being a bit sweeter, but it's still pretty sweet. It had a pretty good flavor. The only thing I would complain about is the boba. The boba was crunchy and dry in the middle, not chewy. My daughters flavored Mango tea was really really delicious. The boba in her drink was nice and chewy and not crunchy at all.\",\n",

       " \"3 photos 4 check-insThis is my go to boba spot when I'm in the area. The avocado smoothie is the best, they use fresh avocados in it and not some powdery stuff and they even top it off with more avocados. The coffee jelly milk tea is great, it has good flavor and just the right amount of sweet. In the taro smoothie, they add fresh taro to it. The boba has good consistency in it and is not overly cooked. If you're craving snacks, I love the lobster balls, it has good flavor and you can get them with no spice to spicey. If you're in the area, check this place out!\",\n",
